The analysis was conducted using 81 haemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences from the H5N1 viruses isolated in Bangladesh from 2007 to 2011, together with 264 publicly available HA sequences of clade 2.2, 2.3.2 and 2.3.4 retrieved from GenBank. Our study provides evidence that clade 2.2.2 viruses that caused outbreaks in Bangladesh were lineages independent from the viruses introduced earlier into India. Furthermore, the Bangladesh clade 2.2.2 descendents subsequently spread to India and Bhutan.This has implications for avian influenza control in southern Asia suggesting multiple routes of entry of the virus including one pathway that spread to neighbouring countries via Bangladesh.","Molecular Epidemiology of Influenza A (H5N1) Viruses, Bangladesh, 2007–2011","Preventative Veterinary Medicine","http://www.thepoultrysite.com/bird-flu/bird-flu-news.php?offset=1700",2013-07-29,TRUE,1,-209,"90","24",""

"1500","GLOBAL",865,"Wednesday, December 31, 2014","GLOBAL - A study pieces together the evolutionary events leading up to the first human case of avian-derived H7N9 influenza.Since the virus’s 2013 emergence in humans, it has been linked to two outbreaks and at least 115 deaths. Phylogenetic analysis suggests the virus is a triple reassortment of H7, N9, and H9N2 avian influenza viruses, but it remains unclear how the prevalence and evolution of these three viruses gave rise to novel H7N9.Jinhua Liu and colleagues investigated the prevalence and evolution of H9N2 viruses mainly in farm chickens in China. The authors’ findings reveal that multiple H9N2 genotypes circulated in chickens for more than 10 years, finally yielding a G57 viral genotype with markedly different antigenicity and enhanced adaptability. The G57 viruses, the authors report, rose in prevalence and sparked widespread outbreaks in chickens from 2010 to 2013. Before long, the viruses contributed a complete set of genetic information to the novel H7N9 viruses, which emerged in humans in 2013.The prevalence and variation of H9N2 influenza virus in farmed poultry could provide an important early warning that novel reassortants with pandemic potential are on the rise, according to the authors.

It's been there ever since and this week its victims are Egyptians. Now another strain of bird flu, H7N9, is spreading in China and the signs are that it might soon rampage across the continent just like H5N1.Meanwhile, H5N1 is swapping genes with other flu strains and migrating still further with its duck carriers. In December hybrid progeny of H5N1 reached the UK, and for the first time ever, North America. These strains are spreading fast: this week one reached two turkey farms in Missouri. The viruses carry the H5 surface protein that makes them lethal to poultry.Neither H7N9, H5N1 nor its progeny pass readily from person to person, although they can kill us.

In this work, the researchers used a social-anthropological approach to gain an inside view of the issues associated with HPAI H5N1 surveillance in the cockfighting community in Thailand. They found that fighting cock owners share a sense of belonging to the same community based on a common culture, values, interests, practices, and internal rules, including rules to manage poultry diseases.During the HPAI H5N1 outbreaks, these rules may have contributed to mitigating the potential risk associated with the movement of fighting cocks inside the country.

Such findings are not unexpected as the EA-H5N8 virus continues to circulate. A novel EA/AM H5N1-reassortant clade 2.3.4.4 was isolated from an American green-winged teal in Whatcom County, Washington. This H5N1 subtype is different from strain circulating in Asia.

"4147","US",1060,"Thursday, February 26, 2015","US - As part of the increased AI surveillance of wild birds (performed by testing hunter harvested birds), another Eurasian H5 clade 2.3.4.4 virus has been identified through whole genome sequencing of the virus isolate. Introduction of the Eurasian (EA) H5N8 virus into the Pacific Flyway sometime during late 2014 has allowed mixing with North American (AM) lineage viruses and generated new combinations with genes from both EA and AM origin (or “reassortant” viruses) such as the EA/AM H5N2-reassortant detected in Canada and the United States. Such findings are not unexpected as the EA-H5N8 virus continues to circulate. A novel EA/AM H5N1-reassortant clade 2.3.4.4 was isolated from an American green-winged teal in Whatcom County, Washington. This H5N1 subtype is different from strain circulating in Asia. The gene constellation is as follows: Eurasian lineage genes (PB2, H5, NP, MP >99% identical to A/gyrfalcon/WA/41088/2014 H5N8); North American lineage genes (PB1 {98% identical to A/Northern pintail/Washington/40964/2014 H5N2}, PA, N1, NS of North American LPAI wild bird lineage.
