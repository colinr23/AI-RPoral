Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, called for the meat to be held back. ?I don’t think they should be taking any risks whatsoever.

However, an investigation by the FSA, which involved tracing the meat back to Hungarian farms, found ?no evidence? that any had been imported from the restricted zones around the outbreaks.

On average, patients died 11 days after the onset of symptoms.

The virus has been detected in wild, feral and zoo birds and recently was found in donkeys and pigs. Most of the outbreaks in poultry and humans occurred in the highly populated Nile delta. The temporal pattern of the virus has changed since 2009 with outbreaks now occurring in the warmer months of the year. Challenges to control of endemic disease in Egypt are discussed.

First detected on 9 April, bird flu spread quickly through the ostrich stock, raised mainly for their meat.
South Africa accounts for 77 per cent of the global ostrich market, and the EU buys 90 per cent of its exports. Or did, until Brussels banned the meat because of the outbreak.

The group studied a subspecies of red knot (Calidris canutus islandica), a shorebird that migrates from the Arctic Circle to Europe. They measured the birds' levels of corticosterone, a hormone that regulates physiologic changes as birds prepare for migration, and inoculated them with HPAIV H5N1 before migration, during fueling (as they prepare for migration), just before migration departure, and after migrating. They inoculated five to nine birds at each stage. They found that, of the birds inoculated just before migration, those that had higher plasma corticosterone levels and thus were more ready for take-off, shed more virus but did not tend to develop clinical disease.
""Therefore,"" they write, ""assuming no effect of sub-clinical infection on the likelihood of migratory take-off, [these findings] may favour the spread of HPAIV H5N1 by migratory birds over long distances.""
